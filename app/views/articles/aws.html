The Rexel UX Team has been set up with Amazon Web Services (AWS). To read more about the overall structure of this wiki, visit the <a href="#/wiki/wiki">wiki article</a>. 
<br><br>
The services currently integrated include:
<ul>
	<li>Github integration with CodeDeploy via webhooks</li>
	<li>CodeDeploy for deployment to ec2 instances</li>
	<li>3 instances of ec2 servers</li>
	<li>s3 Storage for UI assets and private storage</li>
	<li>Route53 for domain name purchasing and url routing to ec2 server instances.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
There is a way to send notifications when code is deployed via CodeDeploy. I believe the service is called 'Lambda'. This is a feature I would like to configure in the near future. A recommendation has also been made to move our main ecommerce servers to AWS and automate the build/deployment process. This is still in the works and may require much more persuasion.<br><br>
To Do: 
<ul>
	<li>Lambda Configuration</li>
	<li>Integrate s3 buckets into this site (requires login/OAuth)</li>
	<li>Integrate API for style guide and wiki</li>
</ul>
