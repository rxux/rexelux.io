<!-- OVERVIEW -->


<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p>For ease of scalability and consitency, we use Bootstrap 3.3.5. The logic behind this is that when we started our mobile project, Hybris' Responsive codebase shipped with bootstrap. In order to integrate quickly, we decided to use bootstrap to build this guide. </p>
<p>We are using the Bootstrap SASS files to build the CSS files for each CSS component. The CSS built during the authoring of this style guide is compiled and used as our desktop and mobile sites CSS. </p>

  <h2 id="overview-mobile">Mobile first</h2>

  <p>We have disabled zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding <code>user-scalable=no</code> to the viewport meta tag. This disables zooming, meaning users are only able to scroll, and results in the site feeling a bit more like a native application.</p>

</hljs>

  <h2 id="overview-normalize">Normalize.css</h2>
  <p>For improved cross-browser rendering, we use <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">Normalize.css</a>, a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/necolas" target="_blank">Nicolas Gallagher</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_neal" target="_blank">Jonathan Neal</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="overview-container">Containers</h2>
  <p>Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use. Note that, due to <code>padding</code> and more, neither container is nestable.</p>
  <p>Use <code>.container</code> for a responsive fixed width container.</p>
<hljs language="xml">
<div class="container">
  ...
</div>
</hljs>
  <p>Use <code>.container-fluid</code> for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.</p>
<hljs language="xml">
<div class="container-fluid">
